## Overview

In this project I mainly needed to focus on page layout and page responsiveness and also functionality.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Input bill amount
- input people quantity
- choose tip percent
- input custom tip percent
- calculate tip per person
- calculate total amount per person

## My process

Create Header
Add logo
Create divs
Add texts
Add inputs of bill and people quantity
Add tip buttons
Create calculator screen
Add Javascript code to give calculator functionalities, of input, count, output responsivelly
Give styles in CSS
Add hover effects in CSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile first approach
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media Queries
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained more practise of using Media Queries & Javascript, the main challenge that I overcame was to create calculator.After research and practicing different ways for resolving this step, I wrote the Javascript code which calculates all the functions, that worked eventually. 

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master coding and make more dynamic, interactive and functional projects
